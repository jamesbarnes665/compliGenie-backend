Bias prevention requires a multi-faceted approach combining technical measures, procedural controls, and cultural awareness. Before deploying any AI system that affects individuals, a bias impact assessment must be completed evaluating potential discriminatory effects across dimensions including race, gender, age, disability status, and other protected characteristics. Testing must use statistically valid methods to detect both direct discrimination and indirect bias through proxy variables. When bias is detected, immediate action is required to either remediate the system or discontinue its use until fairness can be assured.
